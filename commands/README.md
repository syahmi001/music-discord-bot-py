# Command Folder
 This folder contains all your bots commands. Instead of putting all commands in one single file, separating each command into several parts helps in making the code cleaner and easier to debug.

 For reference, you can refer to the official [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html#:~:text=There%20comes%20a%20point%20in,Python%20class%20that%20subclasses%20commands.) documentation.
